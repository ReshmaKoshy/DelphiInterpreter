# Delphi Interpreter

This project is a Delphi interpreter implemented in Java using ANTLR for parsing. It reads Delphi source files, generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and interprets the code by walking through the AST.

# Scope

Object-oriented features on top of the Pascal ANTLR grammr by handling the creation of classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and encapsulation.

## Project Structure

- **src/grammar/delphi.g4**: Contains the ANTLR4 lexer+parser grammar definition.
- **src/main/java/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **CustomDelphiVisitor.java**: custom interpreter using the Visitor Pattern with ANTLR4's Java runtime. The interpreter traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by ANTLR and evaluates expressions, assignments, and statements accordingly.
  - **Main.java**: Entry point of the application that initializes the parser and processes the test files.

- **src/main/antlr4/generated/**: Directory for generated parser and lexer classes.
- **test/pascal/**: Contains sample Pascal source code files for testing.
  - **test1.pas**
  - **test2.pas**
  - **test3.pas**

  ## Prerequisites

  1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
  2. ANTLR4 Runtime Library (included in lib directory)

  ## Building the Project

  First, generate the lexer and parser from the grammar:
  ```bash
  java -jar lib/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Java -visitor src/grammar/delphi.g4 -o src/main/antlr4/
  ```

  Then compile the Java source files:
  ```bash
  javac -d bin -cp "lib/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar" src/main/antlr4/src/grammar/*.java src/main/java/*.java
  ```

  To run a test file: To run the interpreter, execute the `Main` class. It will read the Pascal test files from the `test/pascal` directory, generate the AST, and pass it to the interpreter.
  ```bash
  java -cp "bin:lib/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar" Main test1.pas
  ```
